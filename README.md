## About Clean-Blog

Clean-Blog is a Laravel Based Blog system I'm making in order to learn Laravel. Its named 'Clean-Blog' because it is using the template of the same name - [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog).

### Current Features
- CRUD Blog System - Posts, Categories, Comments
- Authentication - User or Email
- Admin Panel
- Access user by username rather than ID
- Slugs
- Basic Search
- Comments with Parent/Child

As I learn more on Laravel, I plan to implement more features on this project.
